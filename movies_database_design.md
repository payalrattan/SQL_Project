### Representation

**Which entities will you choose to represent in your database?**

- Movie  
- Actor  
- Director  
- User  
- Comment  
- Rating  
- MovieActor  
- MovieDirector  

**What attributes will those entities have?**

- **Movie**: `movie_id (PK)`, `title`, `release_year`  
- **Actor**: `actor_id (PK)`, `name`  
- **Director**: `director_id (PK)`, `name`  
- **User**: `user_id (PK)`, `username`  
- **Comment**: `comment_id (PK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `movie_id (FK)`, `content`, `comment_date`  
- **Rating**: `rating_id (PK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `movie_id (FK)`, `rating_value`  
- **MovieActor**: `movie_id (FK)`, `actor_id (FK)`  
- **MovieDirector**: `movie_id (FK)`, `director_id (FK)`  

**Why did you choose the types you did?**

- IDs and rating as integers for indexing and rating  
- TEXT for comment, names, and title  

**Why did you choose the constraints you did?**

- Unique primary keys for entity identity  
- Foreign keys to maintain integrity  
- `NOT NULL` on critical fields (e.g., `movie title`, `rating_value`)

### Optimizations

**Which optimizations (e.g., indexes, views) did you create? Why?**

- Index on `movie.title` for fast search  
- Index on `rating(movie_id)` to efficiently calculate average ratings  
- View to simplify movie browsing with average ratings and comment count

### Limitations

**What are the limitations of your design?**

- Still no genre or categorization support  
- No login or password protection  
- No tracking of how many users watched a movie  
- Ratings are stored, but no logic to handle disputes or edits  

**What might your database not be able to represent very well?**

- Complex user behavior (like review history or rating trends over time)  
- Detailed production and release info  
- Aggregated or weighted ratings by source or authority
